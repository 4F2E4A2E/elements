  <h1>How it works</h1>

  <p>
    The <code>*axLazyElement</code> directive is used to load any Angular
    element (or any other web component) and display it in the standard Angular
    component template.

  <h2>Angular elements</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (also
    called Web Components), a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a
    framework-agnostic way -
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/elements" target="_blank"
      >Official Angular Docs</a
    >
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As written in the official Angular documentation, Angular elements
    <code>@angular/elements</code>
    provide us with a way to convert standard Angular components to custom
    elements (web components) which then can be consumed as standard built-in
    HTML elements from the point of view of the consumer application.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elements can be built with the help of Angular CLI and
    <code>ngx-build-plus</code>
    <a
      href="https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus#readme"
      target="_blank"
      >library</a
    >
    into single a bundle. Having a single bundle file makes it very convenient
    to consume custom Angular element in the consumer app!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Standard way of using Angular elements (and other web components) in Angular
    applications
  </h2>

  <p>
    Let's say we have created an Angular element, for example
    <code>&#60;your-org-customer-editor>&#60;/your-org-customer-editor></code>
    and built and packaged it into a single bundle file
    <code>your-org-customer-editor.js</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Usually we would have to include
    <code
      >&#60;script src="path/to/your-org-customer-editor.js">&#60;/script></code
    >
    in our <code>index.html</code> so that we can be sure that the element loads
    before it was used in the template of some component of our consumer app.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach has <strong>one main disadvantage</strong>, which is that it
    increases initial javascript payload that needs to be downloaded, parsed and
    executed... Initial payload hurts even more if we're dealing with
    "sub-application" style Angular elements which can be considerably more
    complex compared to single components like button or card.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initial loading time can make huge impact on overall success of many kind of
    applications and represents the main reason for existence of this library
    which enables us to <strong>lazy-load Angular elements</strong> with ease
    and highest possible granularity!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Much Better Way of using Angular elements (and other web components)
  </h2>

  <p>
    Wouldn't it be better if we could use our elements in the same way as any
    other HTML element while postpone their loading from some backend until the
    very latest possible time?
  </p>
  <p>
    More so wouldn't it be great if this happened automatically without the need
    to manually trigger some kind of loading and retrieving of bundle?
  </p>

  <blockquote class="large">
    What if all this could be achieved by using simple structural directive
    <code>*axLazyElement</code>?
  </blockquote>

  <pre [highlight]="codeExampleComponent"></pre>

  <p>
    The <code>*axLazyElement</code> is a structural directive which means it
    will <strong>remove</strong>
    the element on which it was added from the DOM by default. This is very
    useful because we DO NOT want to render element before it was actually
    loaded from the backend!
  </p>

  <h2>Loading mechanism</h2>

  <p>
    Loading starts only once we want to display an Angular component which
    renders given element in it's template. After that the loading goes through
    the following process
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Check if we provided reference to <code>loading</code> template (<code
        >&#60;ng-template #loading>Loading ...&#60;/ng-template></code
      >) and display it in place of the element...
    </li>
    <li>Check if element was already loaded in the past</li>
    <li>✅ remove loading template and render given element instead!</li>
    <li>
      ⬇️ create a <code>&#60;script></code> tag with <code>src = url</code> and
      handler for the <code>onload</code>
      event to notify directive when element was loaded
    </li>
    <li>Append <code>&#60;script></code> to the body</li>
  </ol>
</div>
