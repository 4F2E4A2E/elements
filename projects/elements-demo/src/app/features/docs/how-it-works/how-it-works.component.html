  <h1>How it works</h1>

  <p>
    The <code>*axLazyElement</code> directive is used to load any Angular
    element (or any other web component) and display it in the standard Angular
    component template.
  </p>

  <h2>Angular elements</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (also
    called Web Components), a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a
    framework-agnostic way -

      >Official Angular Docs</a
    >
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As written in the official Angular documentation, Angular elements
    <code>@angular/elements</code>
    provide us with a way to convert standard Angular components to custom
    elements (web components) which then can be consumed as standard built-in
    HTML elements from the point of view of the consumer application.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elements can be built with the help of Angular CLI and
    <code>ngx-build-plus</code>
    <a

    >
    into single a bundle. Having a single bundle file makes it very convenient
    to consume custom Angular element in the consumer app!
  </p>

  <h2>
    Standard way of using Angular elements (and other web components) in Angular
    applications
  </h2>

  <p>
    Let's say we have created an Angular element, for example
    <code>&#60;my-org-customer-info-card>&#60;/my-org-customer-info-card></code>
    and built and packaged it into a single bundle file
    <code>my-org-customer-info-card.js</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Usually we would have to include
    <code
      >&#60;script
      src="path/to/my-org-customer-info-card.js">&#60;/script></code
    >
    in our <code>index.html</code> so that we can be sure that the element loads
    before it was used in the template of some component of our consumer app.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach has <strong>one main disadvantage</strong>, which is that it
    increases initial javascript payload that needs to be downloaded, parsed and
    executed... Initial payload hurts even more if we're dealing with
    "sub-application" style Angular elements which can be considerably more
    complex compared to single components like button or card.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initial loading time can make huge impact on overall success of many kind of
    applications and represents the main reason for existence of this library
    which enables us to <strong>lazy-load Angular elements</strong> with ease
    and highest possible granularity!
